<p>
    I'm Giuseppe Gangi, just a Venezuelan IT Engineer, living in Germany from 2016. I work mostly as a Web Developer
    and love to learn about technology each day. I enjoy to share time with my family and try to travel around the
    world with my lovely wife.</p>

<p>I am a Linux user since I was a child, I have been in several Tech Talks and Hackatons because I like to
    share with people that make great things in the world. I have an IT Engineer degree, and I could define
    myself as a Full Stack Web Developer.</p>
