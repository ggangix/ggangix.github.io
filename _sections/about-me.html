<p>
  I am Giuseppe, an IT Engineer. I work mostly as a Web Developer and love to
  learn about technology each day. My first value is the responsability on each
  project that I am involved.
</p>
<p>
  I am a Linux user since I was a child, I have been in several Tech Talks and
  Hackatons because I like to share with people that make great things in the
  world. I have an IT Engineer degree, and I could define myself as a Full Stack
  Web Developer.
</p>
<p>
  I enjoy to share time with my family and try to travel around the world with
  my lovely wife.
